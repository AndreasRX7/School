[DISCLAIMER: If you are practising at home you will need to install the following modules/packages: matplotlib, openCV, (Numpy comes predownloaded for jupyter notebook)]

#1. Using Matplotlib and the given data, plot a bar chart:
No_of_people_voted=[23, 45, 31 ,40,35]
Area covered = [“a1”,”a2”,”a3”,”a4”,”a5’]

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
No_of_people_voted=[23,45, 31, 40, 35]
plt.bar(['a1','a2','a3','a4','a5'],No_of_people_voted)
plt.title ('Bar chart')
plt.xlabel ('Area covered')
plt.ylabel ('No of people voted')
plt. show()


#2. Using matplotlib and the given data, plot a line chart.
x_axis = [3, 4, 6, 2, 8]
y_axis =[ 9, 10, 8, 7, 6]

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
x=np.array([3, 4, 6, 2, 8])
y=np.array ([9,10,8,7,6])
plt.plot(x,y)
plt.show()


#3. WAP to read csv file saved in your system and display its information.

import pandas as pd
s=pd.read_csv("[Enter the directory of the csv file]")
print(s)


#4. WAP to read csv file saved in your system and display its information.
(The question appears to be repeated in the file sent by the school. From what I can understand from the file this seems to be the same as above but instead shows mean values)
(Use your brain.)

import pandas as pd
s=pd.read_csv("D:\jaipur.csv")
print(s.head(5))
s1=s.sort_values(by=’date’,ascending=False)
print(s1)


#5. Write a program to read an image and display using Python.

import cv2 as cv
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
img=cv.imread('[Enter the directory of the image here]')
plt.imshow(img)
plt.show()


#6. Write a program to read an image and upload and display an image in grayscale mode.

import cv2
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
img=cv2.imread('[Enter the directory of the image here]',0)
plt.imshow(img,cmap='gray')
plt.title('Taj Mahal')
plt.axis('off')
plt.show()


#7. Upload an image of favourite picture and display the picture in RGB color

import cv2
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
img=cv2.imread('D:/mycity.jpeg’)
plt.imshow(cv2.cvtColor(img,cv2.COLOR_BGR2RGB))
plt.title('picture')
plt.axis('off')
plt.show()
